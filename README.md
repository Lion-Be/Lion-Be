### Hi and welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Candidate at the University of Mannheim and Data Scientist working with various data science tools and methods for a variety of different purposes. I mainly code in R [#rstats](https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hashtag_click), with an eager eye on Python:fire: Some of my projects include:  

- :computer: Some smaller programming exercises that caught my interest throughout the last years such as programming a [Gibbs sampler](https://github.com/Lion-Be/gibbs) for Bayesian inference, constructing [OLS solutions](https://github.com/Lion-Be/linreg) using matrix algebra or visualizing the [power of a t-test](https://github.com/Lion-Be/Visualize-the-power-of-a-t-test).
